# Overview

For those students already using cloud native technologies and want to initiate and foster a community on their college campus, we have created the Cloud Native Student Toolkit. This toolkit is for students of any discipline, who already have knowledge of cloud native technologies and want to run events (workshops, talks, show and tells etc.) to help their peers learn more and join the cloud native community. We hope this program will help students learn about cloud native and consider it as an attractive career pathway.

## What is the benefit to my community?

By building a cloud native community on your campus, you help your fellow students gain access to industry events, like [KubeCon](http://kubecon.io/), utilize a variety of [training resources](https://www.cncf.io/certification/training/), prepare for [paid open source mentorship programs](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring), and even [find jobs after graduation](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/12/03/success-story-kubernetes-certifications-help-recent-graduate-stand-out-from-the-crowd-and-quickly-obtain-an-engineering-job/).

## FAQ

_Who is this toolkit intended for?_

This toolkit is for any student looking to get into the cloud native industry whether they are currently enrolled at a university, attending a boot camp program, are part of a retraining program, or self learning on their own.

_I love this toolkit, but don’t know where to start building my community._

Many campuses have existing student organizations focused on computer science where you may find interested members. Many tech companies also run campus ambassador programs, like [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/) or [Github Campus Experts](https://education.github.com/experts), that you can join or work with to build communities on your campus. You may also want to connect with your careers center as these skills can lead to job opportunities.

_Who can I reach out to for help?_

CNCF has [Ambassadors](https://github.com/cncf/ambassadors) all around the world with experience organizing local cloud native communities. If you have questions about the program or this toolkit, please contact [students@cncf.io](mailto:students@cncf.io).

## 2. **Free Training courses**

The Linux Foundation has many [free training courses](https://www.edx.org/school/linuxfoundationx) to help prepare you for your journey through cloud native. A few recommended courses are:

[Introduction to Cloud Infrastructure Technologies](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-cloud-infrastructure-technologies)

[Introduction to Kubernetes](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes)

[Introduction to DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-devops-and-site-reliability-engineering)

[Introduction to Service Mesh with Linkerd](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-service-mesh-with-linkerd)

## 3. **Creating a local community and joining the global student community**

Students can create local chapters on [Cloud Native Community Groups](https://community.cncf.io/) to help organize their local group. You can apply to host a group [here](https://github.com/cncf/communitygroups#how-to-apply) and CNCF has many [best practices](https://github.com/cncf/communitygroups/blob/main/best_practices.md) that you can follow. It is also important to reach out to and work with other student groups in your area like the computer science club or tech companies campus ambassador programs, like [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/) or [Github Campus Experts](https://education.github.com/experts). Many communities working together makes them all stronger. You can also join the [global student community](https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-students/) and leverage their community and events for students in your area.

## 4. **Attend [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon](http://kubecon.io/) and [Kubernetes Community Days](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days)**

Students can apply to attend KubeCon + CloudNativeCon and be a part of the largest open source conference in the world. Any student can have a free virtual ticket, in addition students can also apply for a [diversity scholarship](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/attend/diversity-inclusion/) to attend in person. The conference is held three times a year throughout North America, Europe, and China. Look out for the student track for each one.

Closer to home, [Kubernetes Community Days](https://community.cncf.io/kubernetes-community-days/about-kcd/) offer a great way to get involved in your local cloud native community and meet companies in your area for mentoring, internships, and/or jobs. Most offer free tickets for students.
